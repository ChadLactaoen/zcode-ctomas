				<h2>Use family restrooms, not public restrooms</h2>
				<p>
					If you must use a public restroom, use the one designated for families. That way, you can lock the front door and not have to worry about zombies sneaking in and getting you at your most vulnerable. When possible have someone standing guard outside as well so you can open the door and not worry what's waitingon the other side.
				</p>
				<h2>Never enter a room with only one exit</h2>
				<p>
					If you enter a room with one exit, you leave yourself vulnerable to getting boxed in if zombies come to eat you. Always have at least one other exit in mind so that you'll have a backup escape route.
				</p>
				<h2>Always carry a backup weapon</h2>
				<p>
					When your bullets run out, you'll want to have a backup weapon you can rely on to take care of business, especially if you're in a bind. It's recommended your backup weapon is one that doesn't need ammo or electricity to run so that it's always reliable. Our recommendation is a pick axe so you can chop through zombies.
				</p>
				<h2>Travel in groups</h2>
				<p>
					There's always been strength in numbers. 300 zombies is easier to take out with 20 people than just by yourself.
				</p>
				<h2>Do not make friends</h2>
				<p>
					This goes hand-in-hand with the previous tip. You want to be safe and travel in groups, but at the same time, you don't want to get to attached to any one person. That way, if that person gets infected, you have no qualms about putting them out of their misery or leaving them behind.
				</p>
				<h2>Never drive a motorcycle</h2>
				<p>
					Driving a motorcycle is pretty much digging your own grave- they're too loud and offer no protection if a zombie hoard has you surrounded. If you insist on traveling fast and light, consider getting a Smart Car. They're lean enough to get you anywhere and it offers protection from zombies that a bike just can't.
				</p>
				<h2>Invest in an electric car</h2>
				<p>
					You'll be lucky to find a fully-servicing gas station nowadays, and even if you do, the price has gone up ten-fold since the Zombie Wars. Electric cars are your best bet for travel as recharge stations are abundant in the US and it's free.
				</p>
				<h2>Use candles</h2>
				<p>
					Especially at night, it's important to not draw attention to yourself. Rather than use electricity, use candles if you must see where you're going.
				</p>
				<h2>Secure your living quarters</h2>
				<p>
					Board up the windows, add ten locks to each door, and make sure there are no cracks in the walls. It makes it harder for zombies to get in, but it also makes it harder for any light you output to escape from any crevice.
				</p>
				<h2>Never travel at night</h2>
				<p>
					You can't see what's coming at you at night, plain and simple.
				</p>
				<h2>Wear long sleeves and jeans</h2>
				<p>
					If you do get bitten by a zombie, your chances of having their bite penetrate your skin is reduced by wearing jeans and a long sleeve shirt. If possible, wear a jean jacket with your jeans. You may look tacky, but denim is just so tough and durable that it almost serves as a bullet vest.
				</p>
				<h2>Take to the high grounds</h2>
				<p>
					Taking the high ground means the zombies will have a harder time getting to you, but it also means you'll have a good vantage point of seeing zombies coming from all directions.
				</p>
				<h2>Chokepoints are your best friend</h2>
				<p>
					Always try to find an area with a lot of chokepoints. You can handle zombies coming through these areas one-by-one rather than the entire group coming at you from all directions.
				</p>
				<h2>Never eat raw meat</h2>
				<p>
					This is how the zombie apocalypse started and should be rule #1 for those who do no want to become a zombie- ALWAYS GET YOUR MEAT WELL DONE.</p>
