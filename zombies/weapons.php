				<p>
				Since the beginning of the zombie apocalypse, people have done whatever it takes to survive. One of the greatest things to have in defending yourself from the zombie hoardes is a weapon. This list is by no means exhaustive, but it should give you some ideas of the obvious though hard-to-come-by weapons to the ones you can make with household items with little to no cost.
				</p>

				<h2>The Pick Axe</h2>
				<p>
				Unlock your dad's shed and you'll find the pick axe, a great weapon that can help you chop heads as you take names. One hard swing, and you've pretty much killed a zombie.</p>
				<p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> Cost-effective, nearly insta-kill: just add zombie<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> Not as effective against more than one zombie
				</p>
				<h2>The "Other" Axe</h2>
				<p>
				If you don't have the fortune of having a pick axe, you might have to settle for the musician's weapon of choice- the guitar "axe". Many haven't thought to use such an instrument for zombie killing, but after the New York Times ran the legendary story of Paul McCartney smashing a zombie to death with his prized mandolin, everyone started using one as it was the "hip" thing to do. Acoustic hollow-bodies are the worse as they're good for one use only, so try to invest in a solid-body electric. Companies like Gibson and Fender have also come out with zombie-proof guitars that won't go out of tune after whacking one to death, though they'll cost you an arm and a leg (figuratively, of course).</p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> You'll look like one cool dude walking around the rubbles of a city with nothing but a guitar and a good pair of sunglasses<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> Expensive, might not kill zombie
				</p>
				<h2>Any Toolshed Instrument</h2>
				<p>
				Mama told you there'd be days like this. If you can't afford a firearm, then dig in to your dad's toolshed once again and pick your poison. Any type of wrench or blunt tool will work for melee combat, a slegehammer would be even better for better range, and any type of saw (except a bandsaw, you can't wield that thing anywhere, silly) would be even better as you mow through zombie gangs. If you're feeling frisky, that nail/staple gun in the corner that your dad said never to play with looks mighty savory.</p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> Smoke 'em if you got em<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> If you don't got em, you're out of luck
				</p>
				<h2>Shotgun</h2>
				<p>
				The price of firearms have gone up tremendously since the Zombie Wars, so if you still have money in the bank collecting interest, you might as well invest in a good shotgun and shells. I mean, come on, you're not going to save up that money to buy a house now are you? The shotgun is a good, close-range firearm that could stop a zombie in it's tracks while paralyzing other zombies in close proximity. </p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> It just get's the job done<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> Expensive and a bit unwieldy
				</p>
				<h2>Sniper Rifle</h2>
				<p>
				Let's face it, some of us aren't adventurous enough to get up right in the face of a zombie and blow it's head off with our shotgun. Save that for the adrenaline junkies, I'll take a nice, secure area where I can shoot zombies at a safe distance. That's where the sniper rifle can be your best friend. With a steady hand, you can take out zombies Halo-style and then brag to your friends how you no-scoped 50 zombies.</p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> Line em up and kill two birds with one stone<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> Expensive, rubbish in close-range
				</p>
				<h2>Pistol</h2>
				<p>
				For those who want a cheap firearm that's lightweight, you can't go wrong with a pistol. You can shoot zombies right in the face or from afar and not have to worry about lugging around a heavy piece of metal. And if you ever run of bullets, you can pistol whip zombies, when has anyone said they've done that?!?!</p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> Lightweight, cheap, all-purpose<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> You tell me
				</p>
				<h2>Bow and Arrow</h2>
				<p>
				Any kind will do really, but it's hard to be such a sharpshooter with these things. </p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> Silent so not to alarm other zombies to your proximity<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> It's a pain trying to remove an arrow from a zombie to reuse
				</p>
				<h2>Knife</h2>
				<p>
				If you still can't afford a firearm and don't have any tools lying around, the traditional kitchen knife will do. And FYI for the misinformed, butter knives do NOT work on zombies. You won't be killing any zombies with this, but at least you'll have something to defend yourself with.</p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> You do have this lying around the house, right?<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> Won't kill zombies, you'll be mocked for not having a better weapon
				</p>
				<h2>Bowling Ball</h2>
				<p>
				If you have a 14-pounder just lying around the house, why not have some fun and play zombie bowling? When the hoardes come down the street, unleash the power of your ball and try to knock down as many as possible to clear a way for your escape. On the other hand, you can put your ball in a sling and bash zombie brains in.</p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> Possibly the coolest weapon ever, you get cool points<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> Possibly the most unwieldy weapon ever
				</p>
				<h2>Fire Extinguisher</h2>
				<p>
				You may not have this lying around the house, but you can go to pretty much any business (buildings are better since they should have at least one on each floor) and steal one from those "In Case of Emergency" glass cases. Swing one at the head of a zombie to knock them out, bash them with it for the kill. And don't forget you can actually use the extinguisher for it's original use. It's not only a fire retardant, it's a zombie retardant.</p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> Free if you can find one lying around, can put out fires and zombies<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> Unwieldy
				</p>
				<h2>Aerosol Can + Lighter</h2>
				<p>
				If you'd rather start fires than put out fires, a makeshift flamethrower using your spray deodorant and a lighter is your calling. Start the lighter and put it right next to the aerosol as you spew a mighty fire that can set an entire zombie hoarde aflame (zombies are very flammable). </p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> With zombie clumps, you can set the whole bunch on fire with one cannister<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> You can run out of lighter fluid or aerosol at any moment, at which point, you're SOL
				</p>
				<h2>Raw Meat + Sangria</h2>
				<p>
				If you're a pacifist, there's really only one way of slowing down a zombie (can zombies go any slower, you ask?), and that's with raw meat and a bottle of sangria. Zombies really can't tell the difference between red meat and human flesh, and they enjoy ravaging through a good piece of meat as much as they enjoy gnawing at human flesh. The Sangria serves as blood. Soak the meat in sangria and toss the meat at a pack of zombies. They'll be so distracted with their zombie five-star meal that they won't pay any attention to you at all, leaving you time to escape. And if you have excess meat and sangria, well then hey, you have a five-star meal you can cook for yourself when you get home.</p><p>
				<span class="bold">Pros:</span> The humane way of dealing with zombies, plus you can make dinner for yourself<br>
				<span class="bold">Cons:</span> Seriously, save some for yourself. Otherwise, why buy a nice bottle of Sangria?
