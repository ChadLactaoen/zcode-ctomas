		<em>"While our scientists are working very hard to find a cure for the zombie infection, we ask that you keep yourself safe by staying calm and keeping away from those who are infected. Any bites from these individuals will get you infected. If you are unsure if you've been infected, please contact your local CDC to get tested."</em>

		<em>"The consumption of raw or undercooked meat may increase your risk of food borne illness. In extreme cases, consumption of raw meat can result in zombification. It is recommended to cook your meat well done."</em>
