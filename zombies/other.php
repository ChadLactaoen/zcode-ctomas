					If you're a vagabond or just don't know where to go in these dark times, I've prepped a small list of cities around the US that should go to as well as cities you should avoid.

				<h2>3 Worst Places to Live</h2>
				<h3>Las Vegas</h3>
				<p>
					Sin City nowadays is more aptly named Skin City due to high volume of flesh-eating zombies. Las Vegas is no longer the place it used to be back in the days of the Rat Pack. Still, some casinos are still open for business, though they make no guarantees your arm gets ripped off at the craps table by a zombie passer-by. If you must go to Vegas, travel during the summer months- it's much hotter, but it also means the zombies will be migrating to cooler climates.
				</p>
				<h3>New York</h3>
				<p>
					By simple induction and geographical laws, cities that got hit the hardest when zombies started poppin up were the dense, large cities, and New York was no exception. New York was already a sewage dump before the Zombie Wars, but now, New York is just absolutely unlivable. In a poll done by Gallup, 98 out of 100 denizens of New York were considered a carrier or a full-fledged zombie.
				</p>
				<h3>Los Angeles</h3>
				<p>
					Los Angeles suffered the same fate that New York did. Per square mile, Los Angeles ranks at the top of cities with most zombies. Still, the lack of fresh blood in Los Angeles also meant cleaner air, and the pollution that once engulfed the city is a thing of the past. It's still not a place you want to visit, and contrary to Disneyland's motto, it's no longer the happiest place on Earth.
				</p>
				<h2>3 Best Places to Live</h2>
				<h3>San Antonio</h3>
				<p>
					The Zombie Wars prompted Battle of the Alamo, Part 2 as San Antonians fought desperately to fend of hoardes of zombies at their door step. Unlike the first battle at the Alamo however, San Antonians were successful in their defense, giving them enough time to build a wall against the now fourth-largest city (after the fall of New York, Boston, Los Angeles). San Antonio is one of the best places to visit as they are one of the last cities in the continental US to be zombie-free.
				</p>
				<h3>Seattle</h3>
				<p>
					Overall, Seattle is still a slightly pleasant place to visit. When Silicon Valley fell to the zombies, most tech companies relocated their main resources and headquarters to the city of Seattle, where Bill 192.37E was passed. Basically, the Seattle bill guaranteed the safety of businesses within the Seattle area so long as Seattle businesses paid higher taxes to pay for 24/7, city-wide security presence, an electrical fence perimeter, and surveillance cameras. You'll still get the ocassional zombie, but for cost-of-living, you can't go wrong with Seattle.
				</p>
				<h3>Honolulu</h3>
				<p>
					Plane rides are hard to come by because of tight airport security, less air travel, and higher prices, but if you can somehow afford it, paradise is still the place to be when you want to get away. Because of tighter customs inspections and the fact Hawaii gets their meat frozen, there weren't as many zombie cases in Hawaii. Oahu remains virtually untouched, though just to be safe, always be aware of your surroundings.
