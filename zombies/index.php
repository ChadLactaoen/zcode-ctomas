				Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother, you're stayin' alive- truer words were never spoken, but I highly doubt the Bee Gees foresaw the world being overrun by zombies. 
				</p>
				<p>
				If you've been hiding under a rock these past few years, then you've probably missed the apocalypse. You know, the one the Mayans predicted thousands of years ago. "Ground Zero," formerly known as Topeka, Kansas, saw the first case- an incident involving a college student deciding to get his steak rare. Well, the USDA warned us of possible diseases from eating raw meat, but I doubt few would have expected the carnage that would follow.

				Of course, this is a zombie survival site, so I think you know what happened next. "Patient One" as he's now called, had a really bad stomach flu before turning into a zombie and taking out half his dorm. Soon, it was the city, in weeks, it was half the United States, and in just four months, the world was filled with more zombies than humans.
				</p>
				<p>
				And then there was the Zombie Wars. As families and groups of people took shelter in any place they could find during martial law, the US Government took matters into their own hands by bombing certain cities with human-friendly zombie pesticides (or "zombiecides" as they called it). Unfortunately, the smart biochemists who concocted the formula somehow got it wrong. Rather than killing the zombies, it made humans turn to the dark side. Riots broke out at every CDC in the country as well as the White House. And while the President hides in his lovely bunker a mile underneath Earth's surface, the world above is a dog-eat-dog, man-eat-man, zombie-eat-man world. This is no longer the United States of America; this is the Helter Skelter World of Zombies.

				So if you're still alive and miraculously have an internet connection, then you've come to the right place. I started the Zombie Diaries soon after the Zombie Wars started to help survivors...survive. I'll attempt to chronicle my life moving from city to city in search of a safe haven as well as provide you with useful information on how you can protect yourself for the zombie hoardes that are undoubtedly coming your way. Good luck, and may the odds be ever in your favor.
